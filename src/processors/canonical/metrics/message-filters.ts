/**
 * Shared predicates for classifying parsed messages.
 *
 * These exist because three metrics - input clarity, interruption rate and iteration
 * count - each grew their own idea of "a human turn" and "an assistant turn", and the
 * ideas disagreed. Two disagreements were live bugs:
 *
 *   - The parser re-types any assistant message containing a tool_use block to
 *     `'tool_use'`, so `type === 'assistant'` matches only text-only replies. Anything
 *     using it as a denominator or an adjacency test was silently wrong on tool-heavy
 *     sessions.
 *   - Sub-agent traffic (`isSidechain`) was excluded from some counts and not others.
 *     Sidechain prompts are machine-written and unusually dense with paths and
 *     identifiers, so including them flatters exactly the sessions that delegate most.
 *
 * One definition each, used everywhere.
