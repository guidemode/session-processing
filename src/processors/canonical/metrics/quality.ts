 * Version of the deterministic process-quality scorer.
 *
 * Stamped onto every result. Scores from different versions are not comparable, so
 * anything trending this metric should group by it - notably the composite index, whose
 * `aiLeverage` dimension averages this score over a 30-day window and will therefore mix
 * v1 and v2 during the transition.
 *
 * v1 - literal Claude Code tool names; every other provider scored near zero.
 * v2 - provider-agnostic capability mapping (see `tool-capabilities.ts`).
 * v3 - renormalised over applicable components, planning and progress tracking satisfied
 *      by a union of tool families, and `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate` recognised.
 *
 * v3 CHANGES WHAT THIS STAMP IS FOR. Up to v2 it existed to keep incomparable eras apart
 * in trends. From v3 the whole corpus is reprocessed instead, so there is one definition
 * and nothing to split - and the stamp's job becomes marking BACKFILL PROGRESS. A
 * `session_metrics` row whose version is anything other than the current one has not been
 * reprocessed yet, which is what makes the backfill resumable and verifiable by query
 * rather than by trust. Note that rows written before the server path populated this
 * column at all are NULL, not 'v2', so completion checks must test `IS DISTINCT FROM`.
